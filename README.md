# Scribel
### What it does
It is a multi-lingual speech-to-text transcription website. You can upload a wav or mp3 audio file in any language and transcribe it into text. This is especially useful for deaf people and everyday students who want to turn their lectures into notes. Additionally, the entire website is available in many languages using Google's Translation services, making it accessible to everyone around the world.
How we built it
We built this website on repl.it. We used HTML,CSS, and JavaScript to code most of the website. We used resources such as Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and domain.com. We used HTML/CSS for the main website design and used JavaScript, azure, and google cloud to code the translation and transcription part. In order to make sure our and our users' data was protected, we used Bootstrap to format our code. Canva and domain.com were used to build a logo and domain for our website.

### Challenges we ran into
We ran into lots of challenges with the transcription and translation part of the project. We asked a few different mentors and all of them were very helpful. In the transcription part, we ran into the issue of audio file length and how the audio file sometimes didn't return a transcription. We also wanted to make sure the formatting was correct and our subscription keys were hidden and protected. We had times where it worked, then broke, then worked, then broke again, etc. However, we are very happy with the end result and are very glad it now works for our users.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are very proud of how the website turned out, in terms of looks and abilities. The transcription and translation part is something that we are most proud of. We had many struggles along the way but getting it to work and transcribe different languages was a big accomplishment.

### What we learned
During these few days, we learned a lot. Not only did we practice our teamwork and persistence but we also went to many workshops to expand our knowledge in programming. Our mentors help us learn about cybersecurity and using resources like Azure. We most importantly learned about how to divide work in a team and build off of one another's ideas!

### What's next for Scribel
In the future, we hope to add a voice speech feature that will allow the user to input audio from its microphone and we will be able to translate or transcribe the audio while it's still going on. This will add convenience for our users as well as making it more accessible. One way would be using a script to voice feature for individuals with visual impairments or sound wave models for individuals with attention impairments.
